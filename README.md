## Important Facts
1. Meta tag attributes information is used by the serach engine to show results
2. 'alt' attribute of the \<img> tag is also used by search engines
3. You can also add emojis in html text as the utf-8 encoding supports it. It has all kinds of characters from various languages across the globe. Read more about the encoding here.( add reference)
4. '/' means the root. This is something to use when your site is published. When viewing your site locally do not use it. Ex: Use 'images/a.png' instead of '/images/a.png' locally
5. Use percentages in css attributes to make the elements dynamic (relative to the size of the device you are using)
6. Note that 100% == 16px == 1em. Using 'px' is not dynamic but '%' and em 'are' 
7. Use the 'rem' instead of 'em' and '%' to ignore the font size of any parent being applied to that element
8. It is recommended to use 'px' for margin instead of any other unit
